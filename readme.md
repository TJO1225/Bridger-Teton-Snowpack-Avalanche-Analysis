1. Project Title:
Impact Analysis of Snowpack Totals on Avalanche Fatalities in the Teton Range

2. Organization Name:
Teton Range Avalanche Research Institute

3. Problem Description
3.1. Business or Policy Problem:
Increasing frequency and severity of avalanche incidents in the Teton Range, potentially linked to varying snowpack levels, leading to increased fatalities and injuries.

3.2. Affected Parties:
Local communities, tourists, emergency response teams, and conservation groups in the Teton Range area.

3.3. Magnitude of the Problem:
Annually, avalanches in the Teton Range affect hundreds of individuals through direct impact or subsequent economic and social disruption.

3.4. Priority:
Addressing this issue is crucial for improving public safety and enhancing the effectiveness of avalanche prevention measures.

3.5. Previous Efforts:
Previous efforts have included public awareness campaigns and avalanche training programs, which have not sufficiently reduced the number of fatalities.

3.6. Stakeholders:
Local government, National Park Service, Teton Range Avalanche Research Institute, local community groups, and tourism operators.

4. Goals
4.1. Goals and Constraints:
Goal: Reduce the number of avalanche-related fatalities by 30% within three years.
Type: Effectiveness
Constraints: Limited funding for extensive field research.
Goal: Increase community and tourist awareness about avalanche risks and safety measures.
Type: Efficiency
Constraints: High variability in tourist populations, language barriers.
Goal: Enhance real-time monitoring and predictive capabilities for avalanche occurrences.
Type: Equity
Constraints: Technological limitations and need for high-frequency data collection.
4.2. Trade-offs:
The goal to reduce fatalities (effectiveness) may require more resources, possibly limiting immediate widespread public education campaigns (efficiency). Prioritizing real-time predictive capabilities might initially benefit only areas with existing infrastructure for monitoring.

5. Actions
5.1. Planned Actions:
Deploy additional weather monitoring stations.
Goal: Enhance predictive capabilities.
Executed by: Teton Range Tech Department
Frequency: Setup completed once, monitored continuously.
Channels: Physical installation and digital monitoring.
Resource Constraints: Limited stations available.
Organize annual avalanche safety workshops.
Goal: Increase public awareness.
Executed by: Community Outreach Coordinators
Frequency: Annually before ski season.
Channels: In-person and online sessions.
Ethical Issues: Ensuring equitable access to information regardless of socio-economic status.
6. Data
6.1. Internal Data Sources:
Avalanche Incident Reports
Details: Dates, locations, snow conditions, and involved parties.
Granularity: Incident level
Frequency: After every reported avalanche.
Weather Station Outputs
Details: Snowpack data, temperature, precipitation records.
Granularity: Daily
Frequency: Real-time data collection.
6.2. External Data Sources:
National Weather Service Database
Details: Historical climate data for the Teton Range.
Granularity: Daily records.
Frequency: Updated daily.
7. Analysis
7.1. Planned Analyses:
Correlation and Regression Analysis between snowpack levels and avalanche incidents to predict high-risk conditions.
Time Series Analysis of weather patterns to forecast hazardous avalanche conditions.
Survival Analysis to understand the probabilities of fatalities based on different snowpack conditions and to refine emergency response times.
8. Ethical Considerations
8.1. Privacy and Security:
Ensure all personal data from incident reports are anonymized before analysis to protect victim identities.

8.3. Discrimination/Equity:
Ensure that safety measures and information dissemination do not favor certain groups over others, particularly in terms of access to safety equipment and training.

8.4. Social License:
Maintain transparency with the public about data collection methods, particularly regarding monitoring technologies that may be perceived as surveillance.

This scoping document provides a comprehensive outline to guide the data science project, ensuring all aspects are covered from data collection to ethical considerations.
